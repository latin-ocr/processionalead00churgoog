The additional matter contained in the later editions is marked ,
l

by strong brakets, and the chief variatione are given in the
notes. The two first editione, 1508 and 1517, appear to bo
clearly the most con-eet, ancl fmtunatnly they are quite indepen-
dent of each other.

The colophon of the 150⁸ book will be found at the end of
this reprint3 the title is on follows :—

Processionnle ad usum insignis ac puccium) ecelesioe Sanun
noviter sm rursus castigatum por excellentissimum nc vigilan-
tissimum et reverendissimum in Chsisto patrem domnum nostrum
epieoopum de Wynton feliciter incipit. The bishop referred to is
Richard Fox, of Wincheeter, whose arms follow on the title page.

The title of the edition of 1517 is—

Processionale ad usum matris ecclesia) San recentissime nc de
novo ampliatum et ultra prius impie-esa tam in notulis et precibus

juxto antiquam et modernam veritatem solerti vigilantia ac

diligenti cura correctum atque emendatum Bothum-agi pm· ¹

Magistrum Martinam Morin impressum. Impensis honesti vii-i
Johanuis Gaillard libran'i dieti Rothomugi commorantis. Anno
Domini millesimo quingentesimo decimo septimo.

The most notable vario-tion between the editions collatetl is
the omission of the part of the Prophet in the Proeession on Palm
Sundey, which os for as I an] aware ie only found in the first two
editions, aud in a Marion one of 1555, belonging to Mr. J. D.
Ohnmbem. The office fur Si Thomas of Canterbury is erased in
some edition-³, entirely omitted in others, It is not restored in
the 1554 book.

Of woodaues thoro ere two sets: first, that ol* the 1508 book,
of which fausimiles ure given in this volume; 1 have not found
this eet repeated in any other edition. Secondly, that found in all
eueh luter editions that I heve soen which have woodcuts. Ono
