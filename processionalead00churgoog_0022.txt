Prosece. xiir

(4) The proeession went outside the ehurch on Ascension Dey
and Corpus Christi3 outside the ehurch and churehyard‚

and the city itself, on S. Mark's and the three Rogation
Days.

The processional ohants were various.

Ordinarily, a response, sometimes an antiphon was sung, eon-
trived so as to end as the proeession reeehed the rood3 on ten
days, instead of responsories, proses were sung, generally by

three clerks in the eentre of the procession, with a refrain

by the ohorus; the refrain, in ease of the non-metrieal preses,
consisting of a series of notes sung on the last vowel of the first
line3 in case of the metricel ones, in the repetition of the first
conplet. On some days, as Easter Day, psalms were ehanted ; ,ἢ
on others, hymns 3 and on Wednesdays and Saturdays in Lent, the
Eves of Eester and Pentecost, and S. Mark’s, and the three Roga·

tion Days, litanies of various forms.

Lighted tapers were carried at the vesper processione on
Ohristmas Day and the three days following, and the altars
end imeges were incensed. On the processione to the altars of
the ehurch on the first vespere of feasts of the saints to whom
they were dedicated, incense was similarly used, as also attho
font on the Thursday in Pession Week, Easter and Pentecost
Eves. Benners were carried on Palm Sundey after the first
station, and on Corpus Christi, and with the special banners of
the lion and the dragon on Rogation Days and Ascension3 on
Aah Wednesday and Thursday in Pession Week, a hair-eloth
benner was carried at the ejection and restitution of penitents.
Relies were earried on Palm Sundey, Rogation Days, and Ascen-

· sion, and on the Feest of Relics.
