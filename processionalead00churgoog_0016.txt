of these, which is additional to those of 1508, will be found at
page 12. The copes of the priests and rulers of thc choir aro

In these woodouts only two of the symbols need be notioed-
lst‚ the Tau-sheped figures to represent the staves of the rulers of
the cheir. Rulers' staves were ordinarily made of this shape, and
'of boxwood, allowing an image or other ornament to be placed on
them. See Walcott's “ Glossary of Sacred Archaeology,'' under the
words “baton'' and “staff'' and Pugin's ‘¹ Glossary of Ecclesi-
astical Ornament and Oostume‚’' where a simple staff, much of
this shape but of more eostly materials, is described. Tho staves
that are engraved in various books are of a far more costly
character. Secondly, in the woodout for processions on Saturdays
from Trinity to Advent, p. 129, are two conical projections on the
heads of the chanters or rulers of the choir; these are not found
in the second set of woodouts. I take them to be the apparels of

the amyce. In Picart's “Book of Religious Ceremonies‚’' in the

plate for Palm Sunday, the amyces ure drawn exactly in this way,
though on the oentre of the forehead. See too Pugin's article
on “ AmyceS‚'’ where this drawing of Picart’s is referred to.

A few remarks may be excused upon one or two torma .

“Proses,” apparently so called as being canticlcs not bonml
by strict lows of rhythm or metro, were originally words set
to the neuma, p. 97, or cadenoe which followed the Alleluia. Of
these'there are two forms in this volume-ist, the ordinary
prose or sequence, as on Christmas and the four following days
